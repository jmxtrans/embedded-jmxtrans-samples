# Using the CopperEggWriter Output Writer

## Deploying with the Cocktail Demo App

### 1. Save a copy of your current resources/jmxtrans.json file

```xml
    cd <path-to-embedded-jmxtrans-samples> 
    mv embedded-jmxtrans-webapp-coktail/src/main/resources/jmxtrans.json embedded-jmxtrans-webapp-coktail/src/main/resources/jmxtrans.json.original
```

### 2. Copy the CocktailDemo-specific copperegg_config.json and jmxtrans.json to resources/

```xml
    cd <path-to-embedded-jmxtrans-samples> 
    cp embedded-jmxtrans-webapp-coktail/src/main/copperegg/copperegg_configCocktailApp/*.json embedded-jmxtrans-webapp-coktail/src/main/resources/
```

### 3. Edit the (newly-copied) jmxtrans.json file

```xml
    cd <path-to-embedded-jmxtrans-samples> 
    nano embedded-jmxtrans-webapp-coktail/src/main/resources/jmxtrans.json
    In the "OutputWriters" array, find the CopperEggWriter settings.
        Replace  <YOUR_USER_NAME>  with your user name
        Replace  <YOUR_APIKEY> with your Uptime Cloud Monitor APIKEY
    Optionally, add any other OutputWriters to the OutputWriters array.
    Save and close jmxtrans.json
```

### 4. Build and Deploy the Cocktail Demo App as usual.
